# Flickr-API App

## Live Example : https://liamcavens-flickr-app.netlify.com/

### Libraries Used : InfiniteScrollComponent, React Modal Component

### InfiniteScrollComponent

I used this pre-build component as I thought it was reliable enough as it had more than 1 Million download usages, more than 1,000 stars and had well written documentation.

### React Modal Component

I used the react-modal component here instead of trying to build my own as it was clear to use and well documentated, and easy to implement.

## To Run

### npm install

then

### npm start to start
### npm build to build
